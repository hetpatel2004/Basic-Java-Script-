1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has 8 data-type:
Primitive types:

String - e.g., "Hello"

Number - e.g., 42, 3.14

BigInt - for large integers, e.g., 123n

Boolean - true or false

Undefined - variable declared but not assigned

Null - represents “no value”

Symbol - unique identifiers
Non-primitive:
Object - collection of key-value pairs (includes arrays, functions, etc.)


2. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

| Feature        | var                              | let                   | const                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Scope          | Function-scoped                  | Block-scoped          | Block-scoped          |
| Re-declaration | Allowed                          | Not allowed           | Not allowed           |
| Re-assignment  | Allowed                          | Allowed               | Not allowed           |
| Hoisted        | Yes (initialized as undefined) | Yes (not initialized) | Yes (not initialized) |


3. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting means moving declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
However, only the declaration is hoisted — not the initialization.

4. Explain the concept of closures.

A closure is created when a function “remembers” the variables from its outer scope even after that scope has finished executing.

5. What is the difference between == and ===?

| Operator | Description                                         | Example             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ==     | Compares *values only* (performs type conversion) | '5' == 5 → true   |
| ===    | Compares *values and types* (strict equality)     | '5' === 5 → false |


6. What is a callback function?
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.\

7. What are arrow functions?
Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions introduced in ES6.
They also don`t have their own this.

8. What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?

| Type                     | Example                                        | Hoisted? |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| *Function Declaration* | function add(a, b) { return a + b; }         |
| *Function Expression*  | const add = function(a, b) { return a + b; } |

9. What are template literals?

Template literals (using backticks `) allow embedding variables and expressions easily using ${}.

10. What are default parameters in functions?

Default parameters let you assign a default value to a function parameter if no value is provided.
